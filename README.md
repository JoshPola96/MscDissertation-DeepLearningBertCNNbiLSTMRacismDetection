# MSc Dissertation: A Novel Racism Detection Model Aiming to Minimize Bias

Curriculum Work / Dissertation

## Overview

This project presents a multi-modal neural network model designed for detecting racism with the goal of minimizing bias. The model combines BERT, CNN, and biLSTM for text classification, and Dense Neural Networks for numerical and categorical classification.

## Description

The model integrates several advanced techniques:
- **BERT-CNN-biLSTM:** Utilizes BERT for contextual text embeddings, CNN for feature extraction, and biLSTM for capturing sequential dependencies.
- **Dense Neural Networks:** Applied for handling numerical and categorical features.

### Key Points:
- BERT does not require certain preprocessing steps like emoji removal or text segmentation as it can infer context from these elements, which are also included within the code.
- The implementation provided in this repository is based on snippets rather than complete implementations.
- The resources available in 2021 were limited, and this repository aims to serve as a valuable reference for data science students and NLP practitioners.
